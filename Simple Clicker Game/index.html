        <h1>Simple Clicker Game</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the simple clicker game! Click the button below labeled "Click Me" to earn points. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible. Once you have earned 100 points, the "Upgrades Menu" will become available. You can use the upgrades to increase your click speed and earn more points. Later on, you will be able to unlock the "Prestige Menu" which will allow you to reset your progress in exchange for a multiplier. The game will continue to get progressively harder as you earn more points. If you need help or have any questions, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
